# GPA-calculator-python

IMPORTANT: this program has been formatted so that it works specifically for UWL transcripts.   
OTHER COLLEGE TRANSCRIPTS MAY BREAK THIS CODE because of their formatting. 

The purpose of this humble, simple little program is to allow students to figure out what GPA they need in the future in order to maintain their goal GPA. i.e. I can use this to see what GPA I need next semester to maintain a 3.5 GPA

All that you need to do is input your unofficial transcript (downloaded as a PDF) and goal GPA and the program will figure out the rest. 

This program is intended for linux OS

running from terminal, these are what the args should be:   
arg[0] = program name
arg[1] = transcript pdf 
arg[2] = goal gpa
